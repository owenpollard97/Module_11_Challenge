In this project, I mastered web scraping and data analysis techniques to extract valuable information from web pages. I adeptly identified HTML elements, harnessed attributes like id and class, and employed tools like Splinter and Beautiful Soup for automated browsing and HTML parsing.

For Deliverable 1, I meticulously scraped Mars news articles' titles and preview text, employing targeted extraction methods to gather the desired information effectively.

In Deliverable 2, I delved into scraping and analyzing Mars weather data, navigating through HTML tables to extract and interpret the relevant data points.

Throughout this endeavor, I honed my abilities in data collection, organization, storage, analysis, and visual communication, paving the way for more sophisticated projects down the line.
